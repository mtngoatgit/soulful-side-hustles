# CHAPTER 1
## A holy kind of healing
For many, Jung's appeal lies in the optimistic tone of his thought for there is no sense in his writing that psychological characteristics are inborn and without the potential of development or change. There is a distinct absence of the ridding of symptoms that we find in Freud's therapeutic model and a rather abundant concern that the analyst help his or her patients to engage with their symptoms in an attitude of acceptance. The essence of Jungian therapy lies not in asking what is missing or repressed but in focusing upon & that which is available within the therapeutic alliance and the potential this gives the individual. In fact, it appears that Jung wanted to dispel the Freudian perception that analysis simply alleviates and removes troublesome symptoms. He writes, [T]here is a widespread prejudice that analysis is something like a "cure" to which one submits for a time and is then discharged healed. That is a layman's error left over from the early days of psy-choanalysis' (1916/1957: par. 142). For Jung, the analytic task is altogether more comprehensive and focused on the whole man', not just his missing or repressed parts. For,

> The object of therapy is not the neurosis, but the man who has the neurosis. ... Nor does it [neurosis] come from an obscure corner of the unconscious, as many psychotherapists still believe: it comes from the totality of a man's life and from all the experiences that have accumulated over the years and decades. (1934: par.337)

It seems apparent to me that such an insight, contrary to Freud's psychoa-nalysis, stems from a realisation that one's personality and symptoms are intimately interwoven and entwined. He expresses this much more directly when he states outright that 'psychotherapy knows first and foremost - or rather should know - that itsproper concern is not the fiction of neurosis, but the distorted totality of the human being' (1945: par.199). Since it is likely that symptoms are deeply embedded within the patient's personality, this distorted totality requires the healing of the psyche through a process [7 / 8] that Jung terms 'individuation', which concerns the evolution of the whole personality towards the attainment of greater wholeness. This process of evolution is brought about through the integration of unconscious com-plexes, which demands that the individual increasingly accept the self that he or she is:

> Individuation means becoming a single, homogeneous being, and, in so far as 'individuality' embraces our innermost, last, and incomparable uniqueness, it also implies becoming one's own self. We could therefore translate individuation as 'come to selfhood' or 'self-realisation' (1929a: par.266)

Rosemary Gordon (1979), an influential member of the London School' of analytical psychology, draws out the very useful distinction between cure and healing: 'to cure' means to 'take care of', 'to take charge of'; it also denotes 'successful medical treatment. Whilst, on the other hand, 'to heal', which means basically 'to make whole', is a very ancient word in the English language, and is closely related to the word holy. Interestingly, Gordon goes on to explain that both healing and the holy' derive from the same roots, haelen, or helag, in Old Friesians, or haelen in Old Teutonic, or haelor and halig in Old English. Such a process is a spontaneous and natural occur rence within the psyche, even if the vast majority of us are unaware of it, it exists as something potentially present in all human beings.

In 1958 Jung wrote, 'my raison d'Ãªtre consists in coming to terms with that indefinable being we call "God"' (1951-1961). To do this, he wrote,

> the knowledge I was concerned with, or was seeking, still could not be found in the science of those days. I myself had to undergo the original experience, and, moreover, try to plant the results of my experience in the soil of [modern] reality.(1963)

In many respects we might view the recently published Red Book as a product of this very endeavor, in the sense that it is a visual and written record of a six-year encounter with 'God', culminating in his own self-revelation and enlightenment. Jung considered The Red Book his most important work;
'everything later was merely the outer classification, the scientific elabora-tion, and the integration into life,' wrote Jung, 'but the numinous begin-ning, which contained everything, was then' (Jung 2009). His position as we shall see in detail, though simply stated now, is that all neurotic problems are generally speaking religious problems. Consequently the basic process of development and maturation that Jung terms individuation becomes a religious process.

The Terry Lectures (1938/1940) represent Jung's most powerful and forceful insight into religion as a psychological experience. It is here that he [8 / 9] highlights the similarity between the development of 'a religious attitude that facilitates self-acceptance with that which we try to capture when we say of someone that they have made their peace with God. He claims,

> If you sum up what people tell you about their experiences, you can formulate it this way: They came to themselves, they could accept them-selves, and thus were reconciled to adverse circumstances and events.

This is almost like what used to be expressed by saying: He has made his peace with God, he has sacrificed his own will, he has submitted himself to the will of God.
(1938/1940: par.138)
Given that psychological healing is expressed, albeit indirectly, in terms of the religious, we might then view the analytical process of individuation as veS equivalent to one's personal search for a relationship with God. At the very least we can certainly conclude that healing consists in finding what can best be described as a religious attitude. Especially if we remind ourselves that individuation shares with religion its goal of union, wholeness and com-pleteness.' Given that individuation has 'for its goal the development of the individual personality' (Jung 1921), it can be construed as the natural birth process of the personality. It is both the goal and natural outcome of life, fundamentally a process of becoming in which we become more truly ourselves. Essentially by separating one's conscious self from the unconscious images that lead us to blind illusions and ultimately self-deception, we are able to facilitate a metamorphosis of the personality that encourages self-acceptance. Whilst individuation should occur naturally, it must be understood that it can all too readily be thwarted by any number of factors - by heredity, the adverse influences of one's parents' education and environ-ment. Clinical analysis therefore catalyses a natural development process.

If a patient is able to commit himself to a dialectical relationship with his unconscious then not only is there resolution of conflict between ego and unconscious but also the energy laden symbols that foster individuation are given space to emerge. Perhaps we might say that the principle task of analytical psychology is to remove those elements that obscure the process of individuation and thus free the personality to pursue its particular path.

Jung's psychology is fundamentally philosophical in the classical sense, a dialectic whose dynamics bring to consciousness not only a more complete understanding of the problem involved, but also the emergence of a new insight. Jung quotes a letter from a former patient that evocatively describes the emergence of such insight and the healing capabilities that it possesses:
> Out of evil, much good has come to me. By keeping quiet, repressing nothing, remaining attentive, and by accepting reality - taking things as they are, and not as I wanted them to be - by doing all this, unusual knowledge has come to me, and unusual powers as well, such as I could [9 / 10] never have imagined before. I always thought that when we accepted things that they overpowered us in some way or other. This turns out not to be true at all, and it is only by accepting them that one can assume an attitude towards them. So now I intend to play the game of life, being receptive to whatever comes to me, good and bad, sun and shadow forever alternating, and, in this way, also accepting my own nature with its positive and negative sides. Thus everything becomes more alive to me. What a fool I was! How I tried to force everything to go according to the way I thought it ought to! (Jung 1929c: par.70).

To reiterate, Jung's analytical psychology does not seek cure for the fiction of neurosis' or other psychological symptoms as its raison d'Ãªtre, but rather strives to bring about a change of attitude in oneself and consequently a new attitude to life in general. The subject undertaking this journey of healing, as is illustrated above, takes a very active role in coming to terms with his or her nature, which is an incredibly empowering and integral part of the healing process. In place of the extinguishing of symptoms and the eradication of suffering there is instead the notion of rebirth, the sense that an individual is to undergo a renewal or perhaps even a transformation of personality through this process of individuation. Jung seems almost to seek the resurrection of man into new life through the regenerative power of the psyche. We might very well conclude that the process of individuation is far from being a method of medical treatment and is instead a spiritual quest - a secular path to salvation. Indeed, Jung concedes as much when he writes, the very aim of religious education, from the exhortation to put off the old Adam right back to the rebirth rituals of primitive races, is to transform the human being into the new, future man, and to allow the old to die away' (1930/1931: 766).

Jung's understanding of 'healing' is I believe in total accord to the ancient derivation of the word. In many ways we might say that Jung's conception of healing falls within the more general psychological understanding of healing as a process of evolution of the whole person towards an ever greater and more complex wholeness. However, where Jung differs significantly from the norm is where I believe the strongest link between Kierkegaard and Jung is to be found; namely that the journey towards the self is a religious one. In the works of Kierkegaard and Jung, immediate experience is the defining. quality of religion; it is a very direct, personal encounter that emanates from within, and by the same token, one's religious experience of the encounter - which Jung refers to in direct allusion to Rudolf Otto (1917) as a numinous encounter, is individual and personal. That is to say, authentic religious experience is not something that is taught or passed down by a religious author ity. Individuation then is understood as our relation with the God within:

> The seat of faith, however, is not consciousness but spontaneous religious experience, which brings the individual's faith into immediate [10 / 11] relation with God. Here we must ask: Have I any religious experience and immediate relation to God, and hence that certainty which will keep me, as an individual, from dissolving in the crowd? (1957: 563).

Inherent in the works of Jung and Kierkegaard is the ethereal sense that when wholeness is attained God is found. The experience of the psyche's wholeness is, for Jung, an experience of God. Similarly, Kierkegaard's understanding of the personality focuses on its potential for becoming whole, understood as a union/synthesis with God. As I shall expound upon later, Jung and Kierkegaard share an understanding of self as that which transcends ego-consciousness. We might best describe the self for Jung and Kierkegaard as one's totality of potential and purposefulness. Individuation means becoming that which God' intended and not that which the ego desires. Whilst the ego must possess the strength to take life by the coat tails, Jung's 'Self-like "GodÂ» >2 is full of ambiguity - it does not refer to an entity as such but rather something altogether much more mysterious.
Jung's psychology requires that the ego be strong enough to take on life but also humble enough to allow the individual to discover the deeper dimensions of life. What is required is the submission to one's calling as a person, an act of humility that allows the deeper mysteries of the personality to be engaged with - those that exist beyond the ego's everyday awareness. In other words, to submit and engage with the religious experience that constitutes the Jungian Self.

## Notes
1. The goal of individuation for Jung is the Self, and the Self is equivalent in its archetypal image to God. 'The self', wrote Jung, 'is our life's goal, for it is the completest expression of that fateful combination we call individuality' (1928:par.404). The subjective experience of the self and that of God are so similar as to be unable of being distinguished from one another. It is through the psyche that we experience all phenomena, including the divine, thus Jung used the term 'God-Image' to describe that aspect of the psyche that receives the experience of God. Therefore, Jung's understanding of the imitation of Christ perhaps offers the perfect unification of human and divine self, whereby one does seek to be as true to his or her own unique incarnation of the spirit as Christ was to his.
2. It is important to note that Jung's Self is capitalized so as to distinguish its transcendent qualities from the ordinary sense of self that he identifies as ego. This usage sets the understanding of self as ego and the transcendent Self (that contains and transcends ego) apart, this allows us to clearly denote where Jung is referring to that sense of self that expresses the unity of the personality as a whole . .. a transcendental concept, for it presupposes the existence of unconscious factors on empirical grounds and thus characterises an entity that can be described only in part, but for the other part, remains at present unknowable and illimitable' (1921:par.789).

## Notes
- Christianity as a panacea 
    - Many philosophies are able to act agnostically
    - Christianity traditionally is NOT considered one of those
    - However, within the past month I have begun to think that it could operate in such a way. 
        - True, some "violence" would have to be done to some of the claims, but as long as you don't tell anybody, I think it could be valuable. Why?
            - Christianity contains a wealth of archetypal images and symbols, such as the cross, the Virgin Mary, and the Holy Trinity, that are deeply rooted in the collective unconscious. 
            - Christianity has played a significant role in Western culture and history. It has had a powerful influence on the development of the Western psyche. By working within the context of Christianity, we can better understand the cultural forces that shape the individual psyche.
            - Religious and spiritual themes can have a profound therapeutic effect. By tapping into the archetypal images and symbols of Christianity, people can connect with deeper aspects of their own psyche and achieve a greater sense of wholeness and balance.

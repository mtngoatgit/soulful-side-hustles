# Week 3 Notes

## Review

### Why Wholeness
- There is the ultimate wholeness that is equivalent to the great achievements of mysticism and enlightenment, BUT
- Wholeness is really just healthiness
- So to ask why one should seek for wholeness is to ask why one should be healthy 
- And I think healthiness is a value of the first order. Sure, healthiness has a lot of ripple affects, but it is also an end in itself.

### What do we mean by "religious"?


### What is a neurosis?

- Salvation is sought through healing, which healing brings about a new orientation to life, and that healing happens through the discovery of one's hidden potential which is the driving force of life (12)
- "Man has the capacity through the discovery of his unconscious life to heal himself" 
    - The understanding that the cavalry isn't coming. This is a solution to that realization. 
- I am sick
    - I need wholeness
- Religious experience is fundamental to one's self-development
- Psychology as THE modern healer 13
    - Testimony meeting
        - Old woman thanked God for leading her to therapy and therapy is the thing that healed her
        - Pre-missionary spoke of therapy as the thing that helped him overcome his addiction to pornography 
    - Why?
        - It has been able to discover more about the human soul because it hasn't been held back by some of the questions that religion isn't willing to ask
        - The psychologist is more likely to accept the whole man without judgement
- The living religious experience is needed for healing 13
    - The interest in psychedelics to imitate that experience
    - We should discuss psychedelics
- The necessity of despair. Why?
    - Because only that intensity of experience generates the passion needed for faith
- Passion is critical for Kierkegaard; he saw the world about him in a state of reflection and not passion and action 14 
- Security over freedom 
    - The grand inquisitor
- Stagnation of the spirit and the loss of the symbolic sense
    - We lose our will to live
- K&J 'can be viewed as having put their culture on the couch and found it devoid of genuine religious subjective, personal, or 'inward' experience.' 14
- Briefly explain Kiekegaard's three phases -, aesthetic, religious 15
    - The aesthetic life doesn't require commitment
- "the individual is in a privileged position to undertake the investigation of himself or herself, unaided by factors outside themselves" 15
- "there is no bliss except in despair; hurry up and despair, you will find no happiness until you do" Kierkegaard 16
    - it is similar to Jung's neurosis and "is a source of natural, life-giving, underdeveloped positive potentialities" (cook)
- Insight into one's self often will lead to insight into others. Working on yourself will help you work on others 16-17
- CRITICAL SUMMARY OF SIMILARITIES:
    - "They are both dialecticians of existence, who share a strong commitment to the central position of the individual; the fundamentally religious nature of the psyche; the limits of rationality; the developments of personality and subjectivity; and finally, of salvation through psychological insight - whether this involves the aid of an interventionist God, ethical code or a particular therapeutic alliance to a certain school of thought." 17
    - DEF: Dialectician of existence


## Jung on psychedelics
"It has indeed very curious effects— of which I know far too little. I don't know either what its psychotherapeutic value with neurotic or psychotic patients is. I only know there is no point in wishing to know more of the collective unconscious than one gets through dreams and intuition.

The more you know of it, the greater and heavier becomes our moral burden, because the unconscious contents transform themselves into your individual tasks and duties as soon as they begin to become conscious.

Do you want to increase loneliness and misunderstanding? Do you want to find more and more complications and increasing responsibilities? You get enough of it.

If I once could say that I had done everything I know I had to do, then perhaps I should realize a legitimate need to take mescalin.

But if I should take it now, I would not be sure at all that I had not taken it out of idle curiosity.

I should hate the thought that I had touched on the sphere where the paint is made that colours the world, where the light is created that makes shine the splendour of the dawn, the lines and shapes of all form, the sound that fills the orbit, the thought that illuminates the darkness of the void.

There are some poor impoverished creatures, perhaps, for whom mescalin would be a heaven-sent gift without a counterpoison, but I am profoundly mistrustful of the “pure gifts of the Gods.” You pay very dearly for them.

This is not the point at all, to know of or about the unconscious, nor does the story end here; on the contrary it is how and where you begin the real quest.

If you are too unconscious it is a great relief to know a bit of the collective unconscious. But it soon becomes dangerous to know more, because one does not learn at the same time how to balance it through a conscious equivalent.

That is the mistake Aldous Huxley makes: he does not know that he is in the role of the “Zauberlehrling,” who learned from his master how to call the ghosts but did not know how to get rid of them again:

It is really the mistake of our age: We think it is enough to discover new things, but we don't realize that knowing more demands a corresponding development of morality. Radioactive clouds over Japan, Calcutta, and Saskatchewan point to progressive poisoning of the universal atmosphere.

I should indeed be obliged to you if you could let me see the material they get with LSD. It is quite awful that the alienists have caught hold of a new poison to play with, without the faintest knowledge or feeling of responsibility. It is just as if a surgeon had never leaned further than to cut open his patient's belly and to leave things there.

When one gets to know unconscious contents one should know how to deal with them. I can only hope that the doctors will feed themselves thoroughly with mescalin, the alkaloid of divine grace, so that they learn for themselves its marvellous effect.

You have not finished with the conscious side yet. Why should you expect more from the unconscious?

For 35 years I have known enough of the collective unconscious and my whole effort is concentrated upon preparing the ways and means to deal with it.”

## Some striking similarities, Personal and philosophical

As I shall expound, Jung's therapeutic perspective and Kierkegaard's theological perspective share a common goal: the development/maturation of personality to its highest potentiality. Subjectivity is not only the core of human existence for both these thinkers; it is the foundation of one's religious life. Kierkegaard and Jung sought what can be described as the 'true' self within the grounds of the Godly¹; consequently the urge towards greater self-knowledge takes on a religious significance. The most important insight we might take from such a reading of Jung alongside Kierkegaard is that through choosing one's true self over the self that one hides behind, an individual discovers that which was latent or unconscious within, and it is this hidden potential that is the driving force of all life. Indeed, this idea that salvation is sought through this particular kind of healing that brings about the birth of a new orientation towards life is the most important link between Kierkegaard and Jung.

_The Undiscovered Self_ (1957) is one of Jung's last works and one that largely focuses upon religion. It is in this work of Jung that we find this curious passage that could quite as easily have appeared in any of Kierkegaard's works: 'Theindividual who is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the physical and moral blandishments of the world'. What Jung describes as being anchored in God, Kierkegaard with a greater sense of poetry describes as 'res[ing] transparently'.² At the heart of Jung's psychological treatment and Kierkegaard's existential synthesis is the shared belief that man has the capacity through the discovery of his unconscious life to heal himself. Whilst such overtones of optimism inherent in Jung's psychology will not come as a surprise to Jungians, what will no doubt come as a surprise is the affinity that Jung shares with Kierkegaard - the philosopher regarded by many as the most melancholic of Danes.³ Much is made of the prominence of despair in Kierkegaard's work, whilst little time is devoted to the hope that flows like warm currents throughout the stream of Kierkegaard's thinking. In the following chapters, I will pursue the idea that the aim of Kierkegaard's religious education is at one and the same time the very goal of Jung's analytical psychology. I will also contend that Kierkegaard, so ardently obsessed with finding the truth that will transform [12/13] one's being, was similarly concerned with one's personal rebirth and salva-tion. And like Jung, this coming into the possession of one's personality and winning through to one's own true and authentic Self relied upon a particular process of self-healing. A self-healing that demands of the individual that he or she suffer and struggle after a life that is completely and wholly one's own, where God is sought in the innermost sanctuary of the Self. Essentially, one is to encounter oneself through encountering God.

Whilst Jung maintained that he himself was only a psychologist of religion and, as such, not a philosopher of religion,⁴ we shall see that he has much in common with Kierkegaard, a self-proclaimed philosopher of reli-gion. In the works of Kierkegaard and Jung we find very little to differentiate psychological and theological approaches to self-understanding. Instead, what we do discover are two thinkers out of kilter with their times, each seeking to understand the process of passage from the conventional experience of the world to an experience of it from the position of the new self, and more importantly, whose solution to the sickness of modern man (his lost soul and superficial Christendom) is almost identical. Whilst Jung did not preach Christianity to be the answer to modern man's ills, he certainly believed religious experience to be fundamental to one's self-development. That Jung viewed the aims of religion and analysis of the human mind as the functional equivalent of one another is, I contend, hard to argue against. Especially if one is to consider here his numerous writings concerning the malady of modern or mass man. As he puts it 'modern man has lost all the metaphysical certainties of his medieval brother' (1928/1931). Which I understand to mean that mankind has drifted away from his transcendental moorings, which perhaps could be said to distinguish conventional Christianity. And again:

> The psychological interest of the present time is an indication that modern man expects something from the psyche which the outer world has not given him: doubtless something which our religion ought to con-tain, but no longer does contain, at least for modern man. (1938/1940: par. 163)

The recovery of the living religious experience was for Jung the most pressing spiritual need of the Western world. In the same vain Kierkegaard asserted that an individual, in relating to himself, relates to God. Kierkeg-aard's synthesis is a creative force that allows the self to choose and develop itself. Kierkegaard writes directly about relating to God as self in Sickness Unto Death (1849):
> A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation: the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the [13/14] infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. À synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self. In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation. ... If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self... The human self is... a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another.

Synthesis is a relation posited by the spirit in freedom that allows the self to give birth to itself.⁵ The essential element in the fulfilling of our eternal destiny is for Kierkegaard to be found in despair. 'It is perfectly true' states Kierkegaard that only terror to the point of despair develops a man to his utmost - though of course many succumb during the cure; but it is also useful for a man to be handled as roughly as all that' (JP: 1850). Despair is the necessary foundation upon which to develop the right kind of passions - in other words, to cultivate faith. His belief that Christian faith could not grow in superficial soil is reflected in Jung's emphasis on genuine religious experience. In his Literary Review (1846) Kierkegaard speaks of his age as the age of reflection: lacking in enthusiasm, a pretentious and superficial culture, spineless and apathetic. It is an age that seeks to create security as a replacement for naturalness of self-understanding of which change has deprived it: such an age lets everything remain but subtly drains the meaning out of it' (Kierkegaard 1846b). In other words, Kierkegaard speaks of the age-old conflict of freedom versus security. Spiritlessness is reified consciousness, "the stagnation of spirit'; such a state is regarded by Kierkegaard to be the lowest form of despair denoting a lack of inwardness and is analysed as a psychological and cultural phenomenon (Kierkegaard 1844b). This is indeed comparable to Jung's reports of the loss of symbolic sense that results in a severage from the deepest resources of the capacity of religious healing. This he says takes its toll on the individual who consequently experiences a sense of meaningless, emptiness and depression. In his 1912 essay 'New Paths in Psychology', Jung spoke explicitly of cultural forces at the root of clinical problems; urbanisation and the division of labour are held to account for having created an ominous psychological crisis, giving rise to modern man in place of his traditional Christian counterpart. Spiritlessness becomes a social complex for both these thinkers.
And so Kierkegaard and Jung can be viewed as having put their culture on the couch and found it devoid of genuine religious subjective, personal, or
'inward' experience.

For Kierkegaard, one's salvation is sought through the decisiveness of spirit. Spirit is the restless inner longing for God that must strive against the inner and outer worlds of spiritlessness; the possibility of spirit is anxiety inducing because the spirit 'constantly disturbs the relation between soul [14/15] and body' (1844b). Kierkegaard's spirit is comparable to Jung's unconscious in that out of the conflict of opposites rises the third thing:

> The human being is a synthesis of the psychical and the sensuous. But a synthesis is unthinkable if the two are not united in a third. This third is the spirit. ... The spirit is present, but as immediate, as dreaming.Inasmuch as it is now present, it is in a sense a hostile power, because it constantly disturbs the relation between soul and body... On the other hand, it is a friendly power, which precisely wants to constitute the relation (1844b).

For both Kierkegaard and Jung, without the tension of opposites there can be no forward movement. Jung writes, if a union is to take place between opposites like spirit and matter, conscious and unconscious, bright and dark, and so on, it will happen in a third thing, which represents not a compromise but something new' (1955: par.765). Jung's salvation (indi-viduation) comes via the restoration of one's personality - it consists of recognising and assimilating the unconscious and bringing about a new center of consciousness. Whereas the achievement of transparency before God constitutes both health and one's salvation for Kierkegaard. The truth of Christianity is, for Kierkegaard, a truth belonging to each individual's existence. His entire literary corpus is an earnest attempt to communicate with the reader the very truth about his life. Kierkegaard's Christianity is not a dogmatic set of beliefs, the emphasis is always upon living one's life inwardly in relationship to God. His mission is to awaken his reader to make him or her aware of their existence. The aesthete, for Kierkegaard, really represented the majority of those who considered themselves Chris-tian. These Christians, whom Kierkegaard believed to live in aesthetic cat-egories, do not engage themselves truly in life, nor do they have a sense of inwardness, as they fail fully to accept responsibility for themselves or heartedly commit themselves to anything. The aesthetic life is despair, but one can recognise his spiritual character through becoming conscious of this despair. Kierkegaard sought to seduce his reader to Christianity and to lure him into Christianity.

Kierkegaard accords this power born of _vismedicatrix nature_ to the individual that psychoanalysts for the most part would seem to deny. Both Kierkegaard and Jung assert that the individual is in a privileged position to undertake the investigation of himself or herself, unaided by factors outside themselves. Despair, one of Kierkegaard's most prominent themes, open or disguised, conscious or unconscious, is the constant characteristic of life;

> there is not one single living human being who does not despair a little, who does not secretly harbor an unrest, an inner strife, a disharmony, [15/16] an anxiety about an unknown something or a something he does not even dare to try to know (1849).

Yet despair is not buried in dark recesses of the unconscious but seems to be something that we have much more control over. It becomes almost a choice; that is, there seems to be a conscious decision to choose one's despair. As he describes it, 'there is no bliss except in despair; hurry up and despair, you will find no happiness until you do' (1843a). Kierkegaard's despair, much like Jung's understanding of neurosis, is a source of natural, life-giving, underdeveloped positive potentialities. He writes,

> if I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility! (1843a)

Kierkegaard, whilst a keen observer of the lives of people around him, was a keener observer of himself. The primary sources for his insight come from his introspection. His unhappiness and personal suffering become the material on which he draws upon to educate others, those who are still capable of happiness, about how to live well. Yet Kierkegaard also had a critical, analytic distance from this sickness. Indeed, this is exactly how he portrays himself in Sickness Unto Death; this book is written as if by a physician. I, the editor, am not the physician; I am one of the sick' (1849). Kierkegaard is patient and physician, the object and the subject of his psychological inves-tigation. His interest in psychology is profoundly personal, Sickness Unto Death and The Concept Of Anxiety being especially anecdotal, but in his attempt to share it and to build a Christian mode of development around it, is testament to his ideas not being private or abstract and dogmatic. According to the Nietzschean scholar Walter Kaufmann, Kierkegaard's psychology suffers most seriously from his peculiar self-centeredness. Consequently, as a psychologist he somewhat limits the applicability of his ideas in arriving at conclusions from a small range of experiences, of which he obsessed for the rest of his life. Notably, his father's sin in cursing God when he was a poor boy, long before Kierkegaard was born; his father's dissoluteness, particularly his problematic seduction of Kierkegaard's mother when she was a maid in his house; his own dissoluteness after he first found out about his father's debauchery; and the way he broke his engagement, pretending that he was a frivolous person, unworthy of his fiancé, Regine (Kaufmann 1980).
And yet, the genuine effort to give universal interpretations to his experiences leads me to believe that his works are not limited in their application [16/17] to himself alone. Indeed, arguably, all understanding is self-understanding to a significant extent. Kierkegaard's psychology is based upon self-anal-ysis, and like Jung, Freud and other analysts of the psyche, he chose to understand himself first and foremost before tackling the great project of understanding all people. But is this not the basis of all Socratic wisdom? Is not to know oneself the precondition for knowing others? There is no reason to think that Kierkegaard's psychology is any more limited than any of those who have founded schools of psychology. Jung's own self-analysis is similar in method to Kierkegaard's attempts to reflect introspectively on his own experiences. In both instances there is an interesting connection between their introspective orientations and the curious relationship that each had with their father. We will discover in due course that it was very much the fathers who set their sons on their respective inward journeys - if it were not for the incurable religious melancholy of their fathers, Jung's and Kierkegaard's psychology would have been very different indeed.

There are many similarities between Kierkegaard and Jung, both biographically and in terms of their work, and the influence these aspects have upon each other. They are both dialecticians of existence, who share a strong commitment to the central position of the individual; the fundamentally religious nature of the psyche; the limits of rationality; the developments of personality and subjectivity; and finally, of salvation through psychological insight - whether this involves the aid of an interventionist God, ethical code or a particular therapeutic alliance to a certain school of thought. Both individuals possess a deep and extensive understanding of human life and its problems; a sense of the consolation of those who experience life in its deepest emotions, and who suffer greatly for a deeper understanding of life as it is available to us. What Kierkegaard and Jung really bring to life is the profound relationship between human and eternal realities; in fact we could say that their very existence was devoted to understanding the conflict between our immediately given nature and our capacity for transcendence - of finding that tenuous connection with a sense of infinite real-ity. Essentially, both these thinkers postulate a transcendental element that facilitates our journey towards wholeness. Common to both Kierkegaard and Jung is a profound insistence upon a uniquely personal and individual experience leading to 'religious' truth. This mode of being, characterised by a highly subjective awareness of truth within one's own existence culminates in coming to know what you are and what you are capable of becoming. There are then similar goals in both Kierkegaard's philosophy and Jung's analytical psychology. They both aim for truth as the honest reacquaintance and acceptance of oneself. Furthermore, both advocate journeys of a spiritual nature initiated by and conducted through a deep sense of despair and spiritual disquiet. Fundamentally, both Jung and Kierkegaard stress that in a world where too many are in despair of being themselves, it is necessary for the development of personality, if it is to attain its highest potentiality, [17/18] for the individual to willingly choose to be himself. I shall expound the similar theories of these thinkers concerning development of self, particularly their respective notions of what can be described as neurosis; whereby a painful lack of the feeling of wholeness is remedied through a spiritual self-healing that brings about the emergence and expression of the true self - or perhaps a more appropriate description would be the rediscovery of the greater 'moral' self. The progressive steps of Jungian analysis and the Kierkegaardian stages of a life-philosophy offer up a salvation that is to be understood with regards to the maturation of this very idea of the healthy self. And whilst regression and despair are the means by which a self-cure is attempted, this is not the illness itself - for the illness exists in the falseness of personality, a self-deception that marks the defeat of the self by the self. Such self-deception is characterised for both Kierkegaard and Jung as a loss of the unifying power of the personality; this is an important point of correspondence between our two thinkers that will be discussed later in Part two, Authenticity: The Creation of One's Genuine Self.

Jeffrey Sobosan (1975) in his article, 'Kierkegaard and Jung on the Self astutely describes the point at which consciousness and unconsciousness, or the finite and infinite, come together, as one where human problems arise. Furthermore, he states that 'to Jung these are psychological problems; to Kierkegaard they are theological ones. This is not strictly true, for that which is for Kierkegaard primarily theological is profoundly psychological, and that which is essentially psychological in Jung is also deeply theologi-cal. How could it be otherwise for a psychologist whose study of religion and religious experience, his wrestling with the self in relation to the divine clearly impacted upon the formation of his psychology? Similarly, Kierkeg-aard, foremost a philosopher of religion, offers us his own psychology which like Jung's is the product of the analysis of his own pathology in conjunction with his religious philosophy; as a result his works contain an immense amount of biographical detail. What I suggest in place of this stark distinction that Sobosan draws, is that there is a greater fluidity between the realms of the psychological and the theological than appears at first glance.
Kierkegaard's spiritual development is profoundly psychological, just as Jung's process of self-development through individuation is fundamentally spiritual. There is this fascinating entwining and interweaving of religious and psychological development that underpins the overlap between Jung and Kierkegaard; self-development proceeds through what can be best understood as moral development of a fundamentally religious nature across the works of these men. Their exploration into the inner world of human subjectivity and the consequent melancholic isolation that accompanies such a search has a common religiously inspired undercurrent. We must not make the assumption that here we have in Jung an atheist intent upon the quest for authentic self-actualisation; rather Jung too emphasises the need for meaningful religious experience and the discovery of the hidden [18/19] God of an inner faith. We should not ignore Kierkegaard's claim that he is a religious author, nor should we ignore Jung's claim to be a scientist Hows ever, we can and ought to take these claims absolutely seriously whilst also appreciating Kierkegaard's brilliance as a psychologist and Jung's passionate reinterpretation of orthodox Christian religion.

However, the potential problem in such an endeavor is that with both Jung and Kierkegaard it is quite possible that one will read into a text that which is looked for in the first instance. Scholars and avid readers alike are able to find the Kierkegaard/Jung that they seek owing to the seemingly contradictory nature of their works. Indeed, both figures surely possess a great appeal to those who seek to canonise their own psychologies/theolo-gies through some sort of association. In short, there seem to be as many different ways of reading Jung and Kierkegaard as there are readers of Jung and Kierkegaard. So rich and alive are these texts that this is an extremely difficult problem to counter; perhaps the best one might do in such a situation is to be acutely aware of this nature inherent in both the works of Kierkegaard and Jung. What I shall take care to avoid is the temptation to detect likeness in unlikeness, so as to resolve diametrical differences into identity. Alongside this endeavor not to misinterpret or misread, in so far as this is possible, I hope to allow Jung and Kierkegaard to speak for them-selves. There exist important differences and oppositions in their thinking, perhaps the most notable being Kierkegaard's profoundly Christian experience of the religious and the unhealthy rigorism of his conception of the authentic Christian that lacks joe de vivre. What demands to be addressed here is whether these differences and incompatibilities culminate providing justification for Jung's complete disregard of Kierkegaard. The question as to whether we might characterise Jung's process of individuation as religious is particularly interesting and contentious. Whilst Charles Hanna
(1967) claims that by studying Jung 'we gain an insight into the ways by which men become aware of God', Edward Glover (1950) writes that 'so far from being religious in tendency, Jung's system is fundamentally irreligious.
Nobody is to care whether God exists, Jung least of all'. This seems more than a divide between what could be said to be a typically Jungian versus a particularly Freudian perspective and is thus deserving of our attention. But first we shall become more acquainted with the life and thought of Soren Abaye Kierkegaard.

## Notes

1. Neither Kierkegaard nor Jung spoke literally in terms of authenticity or 'false as opposed to 'true' self; however, that there are such inauthentic ways to exist that carry pathological implications makes the use of such terms relevant and useful.
2. 'The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it' (1849). [19/20] 
3. See H. V. Martin, Kierkegaard: The Melanchol Dane. Martin is one of the many scholars who has invoked the figure of Kierkegaard as the melancholy Dane, predisposed to the tragic and prime representative of the gloomy, guilt-ridden aspect of Christianity. Podmore (2011) remarks that this oft-repeated legend for Kierkegaard - "the melancholy Dane" - represents a perception that only sees half the face, as it were, of one of modern theology and philosophy's most insightful exponents of the triumph of faith over despair.' (Unfortunately, the darker aspect of Kierkegaard's work has prevailed to the neglect of the divinely lit redemptive dements. There is no denying the presence of darkness; however, the individual must first navigate his or her way through the darkness of the abyss before the divine light may be discovered - again, we see a very clear parallel with Jung's own thinking,
4. Jung states at the very beginning of Psychology and Religion that 'I am an empiricist and adhere as such to the phenomenological standpoint. . . I restrict myself to the observation of phenomena and I eschew any metaphysical or philosophical considerations' (1938/1940).
5. To put it simply, spirit is freedom - it is the third thing that is able to establish and substain the synthesis between body and soul so as the individual is posited as spirit.
6. The only way in which an existing individual comes into relation with God, is when the dialectical contradiction brings his passion to the point of despair, and helps him to embrace God with the "catergory of despair" (faith). Then the postulate is so far from being arbitrary that it is a life-necessity. It is then not so much that God is a postulate, as that the existing individual's postulation of God is a necessity' (1846a).
7. 'The world had not only been deprived of its gods but had lost its soul. Through the shifting of interest from the inner to the outer world, our knowledge of nature was increased a thousand fold in comparison to earlier ages, but knowledge and experience of the inner world were correspondingly reduced' (1912/1952:par.113).

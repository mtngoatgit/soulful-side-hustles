## Individuation
Individuation is a process in Jungian psychology that involves integrating all parts of the psyche, including the conscious and unconscious, to achieve a sense of wholeness and completeness. It is the development of the individual's unique identity and involves the realization of the Self, the archetype of wholeness that represents the totality of the psyche. Individuation involves confronting and integrating the shadow, anima/animus, and other archetypes to achieve a balance between the ego and the collective unconscious.

## Numinous/numinosum
Numinous refers to an experience of the divine or spiritual that is characterized by a sense of awe and fascination. The term was coined by Rudolf Otto, a theologian who argued that the numinous experience was a fundamental aspect of all religious experiences. The numinous experience is often associated with encounters with archetypal images or symbols, such as a powerful religious figure, and can evoke feelings of both terror and fascination.

## Original experience

## Neurosis
Neurosis in Jungian psychology refers to a condition in which a person's ego is overwhelmed by unconscious material, resulting in psychological distress or anxiety. The neurotic individual is caught in a state of ambivalence, struggling to reconcile opposing desires or emotions that have been repressed or denied. The neurotic symptom is an attempt to adapt to this inner conflict, but it can lead to psychological suffering and impaired functioning. Jung believed that the goal of therapy was to help the individual confront and integrate these unconscious contents to achieve psychological wholeness.

## Individuation
Individuation is a process in Jungian psychology that involves integrating all parts of the psyche, including the conscious and unconscious, to achieve a sense of wholeness and completeness. It is the development of the individual's unique identity and involves the realization of the Self, the archetype of wholeness that represents the totality of the psyche. Individuation involves confronting and integrating the shadow, anima/animus, and other archetypes to achieve a balance between the ego and the collective unconscious.

## Religion

## Numinous/numinosum
Numinous refers to an experience of the divine or spiritual that is characterized by a sense of awe and fascination. The term was coined by Rudolf Otto, a theologian who argued that the numinous experience was a fundamental aspect of all religious experiences. The numinous experience is often associated with encounters with archetypal images or symbols, such as a powerful religious figure, and can evoke feelings of both terror and fascination.

## Original experience

## Neurosis
Neurosis in Jungian psychology refers to a condition in which a person's ego is overwhelmed by unconscious material, resulting in psychological distress or anxiety. The neurotic individual is caught in a state of ambivalence, struggling to reconcile opposing desires or emotions that have been repressed or denied. The neurotic symptom is an attempt to adapt to this inner conflict, but it can lead to psychological suffering and impaired functioning. Jung believed that the goal of therapy was to help the individual confront and integrate these unconscious contents to achieve psychological wholeness.

## Dialectician
A dialectician is someone who engages in the art or practice of dialectic, which is a method of inquiry and discussion that involves exploring and reconciling opposing viewpoints or ideas. The dialectician seeks to uncover the underlying assumptions, contradictions, and inconsistencies in these viewpoints or ideas, and to synthesize them into a higher understanding.

Dialectic has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy, where it was used to describe a method of argumentation and debate. The dialectician would present a thesis, or statement of belief, and then engage in a process of dialogue with others to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the thesis. Through this process, the dialectician would refine their understanding and arrive at a more nuanced and accurate view of the world.

In modern times, dialectic has been used in a variety of contexts, including political theory, social analysis, and psychoanalysis. For example, in Marxist theory, dialectic is used to describe the historical process of class struggle and the eventual resolution of contradictions through the establishment of a classless society. In psychoanalysis, dialectic is used to describe the process of exploring and integrating the opposing forces within the psyche, such as the conscious and unconscious, or the ego and the id.

Overall, the dialectician is someone who uses the method of dialectic to uncover and reconcile opposing viewpoints or ideas, in order to arrive at a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the world.

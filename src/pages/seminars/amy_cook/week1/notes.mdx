# Week One Notes

## Brainstorm
- Difference between Freud and Jung
- Art and the artist
  - It is valuable to analyze the artist
    - It helps us see the typology influencing the outcome
    - But it shouldn't be reductive or deterministic
- Different disciplines
    - Philosophy, psychology, religion, linguistics, sociology
    - Each of them have particular rules in their approach
    - Knowing those differences is valuable
    - But for me they are all a investigation of the human condition
- Immanent vs Transcendent
    - Theology vs Psychology
    - Metaphysical vs Empirical
    - Transcendence: God is wholly other
    - Immance: God is wholly present

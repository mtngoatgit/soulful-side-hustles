# INTRODUCTION

Soren Kierkegaard is widely acknowledged today as one of the most insightful philosophical and religious thinkers of Western history. Until very recently psychologists have been more interested in him as a subject of analysis, rather than as a psychologist in his own right. Jon Stewart (2011) notes that many scholars, perhaps inspired by Georg Brandes's 1877 famous study of Kierkegaard (Soren Kierkegaard, a literary character),' have treated him not as a psychologist or even a source of inspiration for psychological insight but rather as a case study?. Fortunately, the tide has now turned and Kierkegaard's particular brand of Christian psychology has been documented in dedicated monographs; however, these monographs certainly do possess a particular leaning towards Freudian psychology (see Nordentoft 1978; Ferguson 1995; Cole 1971). It is notable then that whilst Kierkegaard has been exhaustingly investigated from a Freudian perspective, with the exception of a few very brief comparisons by Jungian scholars, it remains that an extensive Jungian-orientated study has yet to be completed.

Carl Jung, like Kierkegaard, is another complex and controversial figure in the world of psychology: there are those who worship him with a fierce loyalty, whilst others are more interested in discrediting and pathologizing the mystically inclined old man of analytical psychology. At the heart of this book is the psychological theories of these two revolutionary thinkers and the relation that their own individual psyches and life experiences have upon the formulation of such theories. When confronted with a psychology that is primarily conceived through self-analysis and which claims to bring to light and lay bare the human condition, it is absolutely necessary to study that individual as deeply as possible and to pose questions that others might find questionable. And yet it is all too easy to lapse into the pathologizing of deficiencies. I do not intend, nor am I qualified, to diagnose either Kierkegaard or lung. Instead I have striven to balance their extraordinary brilliance with the demons that they faced, without reducing their achievements to mere pathology. It is my hope that through the course of this book it will become readily apparent to the reader that Kierkegaard's rightful place is amongst psychologists, not as an object of psychological investigation but [3 / 4]  as an incredibly gifted and insightful psychologist. Indeed, a psychologist whose insights bear comparison with Jung's own.

This inquiry will seek to provide an in-depth commentary of the many striking similarities between Jung and Kierkegaard, both in terms of their work and their personalities. In Jung's psychology we see the continuation of Kierkegaard's project of selfhood as a divine call to become a self before God. There are aspects of these thinkers' insights that so easily converge with one another and this points towards a significant conceptual parity and complementarity in their thought. We might summarize the most important points of commonalities as: the creation of meaningful existence through inward deepening; the overcoming of self-deception through self-creation/ recovery; and self-determination through the creative exercise of freedom Lin conjunction with a reference (guiding) point outside of one's own. Such complementarity between these two significant figures illustrates the possibility for philosophy and psychology to complement each other in their respective visions of authentic selfhood.

In addition to exploring the inherent and exciting similarities between these thinkers, what makes this a particularly fruitful discussion to be had is the fact that whilst there are works that associate the thought of Jung and Kierkegaard, very few have attempted to directly compare the convergence of their models of development. Though such a comparison seems really very compelling and perhaps obvious to scholars of Jungian and Kierkegaardian thought, it is one that has largely escaped attention. The extensive overlap in their thinking reveal both an intellectual and spiritual correspondence that serves to illuminate just how surprising and odd it is that Jung was not able to find in Kierkegaard a kindred spirit. In written correspondence with Kunzli, Jung refers to Kierkegaard as 'that Grizzler' whose 'problems and his grizzling' served to allow him to settle everything in the study' so he 'need not do it in life. Out there things are apt to get unpleasant' (16th March, 1943). Writing to Rudolf Pannwitz, he confides, 'That you find Kierkegaard "frightful" has warmed the cockles of my heart' (March 27, 1937). Such comments are unfair, unwarranted and undoubtedly illuminate and reflect Jung's own psychological vulnerabilities more so than they address the failings of Kierkegaard's 'insupportable' philosophy. It is clear that the affinity in the thought of Kierkegaard and Jung is much greater than Jung himself, at least consciously, realized. It is to Jung's Library that we shall later turn in order to establish the extent of Jung's knowledge of Kierkegaard. Tackling the question as to why Jung rejects Kierkegaard is a primary concern, the reason behind which we shall try to discover in the following pages.

Not only is there no single Jungian-orientated monograph devoted to Kierkegaard's psychology or its possible bearing on Jung's own psychology, there are no Jungian studies of Kierkegaard, the man. This alone strikes me as surprising, but when we combine this Kierkegaardian absence with the very emotive and negative comments Jung makes of Kierkegaard in regards [4 / 5 ] to both his philosophy and character, then such absence seems remarkable.

This is not to say that these negative comments or the similarity between the respective psychological projects of Jung and Kierkegaard has gone unnoticed. Prominent Jungian analyst Ann Casement (1998) very briefly explores the 'striking affinity' between these two deeply spiritual men, both of whom 'were antipathetic to conventional Christianity'. However, she merely alludes to, rather than analyses, what she insightfully perceives to be a shared psychological inheritance between Kierkegaard and Jung. John Dourley (1990) in his Jung, Tillich, and Aspects of Western Christianity notes Jung's rejection of Kierkegaard and interprets its origins to Kierkegaard's distancing of the realities between man and God3.4 This interpretation, as we will later discover, readily enforces Jung's own distorted view of Kierkegaard, and as a consequence, Dourley unquestionably reinforces the idea that what Kierkegaard lacks and needs is the corrective of the immanent presence of God. The most substantial exploration of Jung's relation to Kierkegaard's psychology is to be found in Anthony Rudd's essay 'C.G. Jung: A missed connection' which forms part of Kierkegaard's Influence on the Social Sciences (Stewart, 2011). Notably Rudd draws together Kierkegaard and Jung's view of the self and argues that the achievement of selfhood for both men requires that the various aspects of the self are consciously taken up as parts of who one is. The failure to integrate and balance the various aspects of the personality leads, according to Kierkegaard, to despair in its various forms. Whereas, for Jung, these aspects of unintegrated self can potentially become pushed into the unconscious where they assume crude and undeveloped forms (becoming what Jung calls 'the shadow'). Rudd draws attention to Jung's apparent unawareness that Kierkegaard was involved in the same cultural and religious problem situation as himself; namely, the banalisation of Christian concepts that arises in modern misappropriations of 'Christian' society and 'Christian' culture. However, he downplays Jung's hostile response to Kierkegaard by pointing towards Kierkegaard's relative anonymity outside of Scandinavia during Jung's student days. Furthermore, Rudd reflects that whilst the work of Kierkegaard had begun gathering a momentum amongst the intelligentsia following World War I, Jung's main ideas were already formed, and, though he considerably elaborated on them, he showed little interest in considering new perspectives from philosophy or theology'. Rudd makes no mention of Arnold Kunzli, a frequent correspondent of Jung and whose dissertation thesis on Kierkegaard Jung possessed two copies of in his library. This PhD thesis is crucial in revealing what Jung could have known of Kierkegaard's personality and religious philosophy. Moreover, whilst Jung may well have been uninterested in new perspectives as Rudd claims, he does make use of philosophy that reinforces his own views and this would not preclude Kierkegaard. This book seeks to rectify these issues and proposes to attempt to bridge the gap in Jungian [5 / 6] scholarship regarding the figure of Kierkegaard, particularly in regards to addressing Jung's outright and venomous rejection of him. It will thereby be the most thorough study to date to explore the extensive overlap and affinity between their models of psychological development and illness. It will also be the first, albeit tentative, attempt at a Jungian analysis of the melancholy Dane.

Part One of this book outlines some striking similarities between the works of Jung and Kierkegaard, whilst drawing together Jung's conception of the unconscious and Kierkegaard's notion of spirit. The ideas here are presented abstractly and generally are given a more intensive treatment in Part Two. These chapters therefore seek to trace and concretize the essential similarities in their respective works through a thorough exploration of three key themes of overlap: authenticity, suffering and self-deception.

Everything in this exposition is carefully interconnected, and consequently this means that in a certain sense new aspects of the same parallels between the life and works of Jung and Kierkegaard are continually being developed. Having worked towards establishing a strong comparison between Jung and Kierkegaard, Part Three is devoted solely to a Jungian analysis of Kierkegaard, setting the scene for Part Four, In the Shadow of Jung'. This concluding segment will revisit these scathing comments of Jung with a view of ascertaining why - given the otherwise strong affinities between his work and Kierkegaard's - he made these very odd and curious remarks.
